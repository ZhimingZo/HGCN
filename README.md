## Introduction

We propose High-order Graph Convolutional Networks (HGCN), a novel graph convolutional network architecture that operates on regression tasks with graph-structured data. The code of training and evaluating our approach for 3D human pose estimation on the [Human3.6M Dataset](http://vision.imar.ro/human3.6m/) is provided in this repository.

In this repository, 3D human poses are predicted according to **Configuration #1** in [our paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.03345.pdf): we only leverage 2D joints of the human pose as inputs. We utilize the method described in Pavllo et al. [2] to normalize 2D and 3D poses in the dataset, which is different from the original implementation in our paper. To be specific, 2D poses are scaled according to the image resolution and normalized to [-1, 1]; 3D poses are aligned with respect to the root joint . Please refer to the corresponding part in Pavllo et al. [2] for more details. We predict 16 joints (as the skeleton in Martinez et al. [1] without the 'Neck/Nose' joint). We also provide the results of Martinez et al. [1] in the same setting for comparison.

### Results on Human3.6M

Under Protocol 1 (mean per-joint position error) and Protocol 2 (mean per-joint position error after rigid alignment).

| Method | 2D Detections | # of Epochs | # of Parameters | MPJPE (P1) | P-MPJPE (P2) |
|:-------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Martinez et al. [1] | Ground truth | 200  | 4.29M | 44.40 mm | 35.25 mm |
| SemGCN | Ground truth | 50 | 0.27M | 42.14 mm | 33.53 mm |
| SemGCN (w/ Non-local) | Ground truth | 30 | 0.43M | 40.78 mm | 31.46 mm |
| HGCN   | Ground truth | 50 |  1.20M  | **39.52 mm | **31.07** |

Results using Ground truth are reported.

## Quick start

This repository is build upon Python v3.7 and Pytorch v1.3.1 on Ubuntu 18.04. NVIDIA GPUs are needed to train and test. See [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) for other dependencies. We recommend installing Python v3.7 from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), and installing Pytorch (>= 1.3.1) following guide on the [official instructions](https://pytorch.org/) according to your specific CUDA version. Then you can install dependencies with the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:ZhimingZou/HGCN.git
cd HGCN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Dataset setup
You can find the instructions for setting up the Human3.6M and results of 2D detections in [`data/README.md`](data/README.md). The code for data preparation is borrowed from [VideoPose3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/VideoPose3D).

### Evaluating our pretrained models
The pretrained models can be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13gBcCX6nQwzRN0jrhP5Fl7KwVa57-MCI). Put `checkpoint` in the project root directory.

To evaluate HGCN, run:
```
python main_gcn.py --evaluate checkpoint/pretrained/ckpt_hgcn_best.pth.tar
```

Note that the error is calculated in an **action-wise** manner.

### Training from scratch
If you want to reproduce the results of our pretrained models, run the following commands.
For HGCN:
```
python main_gcn.py --epochs 50
```
By default the application runs in training mode. This will train a new model for 50 epochs, using ground truth 2D detections. You may change the value of `num_layers` (4 by default) and `hid_dim` (96 by default) if you want to try different network settings. Please refer to [`main_gcn.py`](main_gcn.py) for more details.

For training and evaluating models using 2D detections generated by Cascaded Pyramid Network, add `--keypoints cpn_ft_h36m_dbb` to the commands:
```
python main_gcn.py --keypoints cpn_ft_h36m_dbb
python main_gcn.py --evaluate ${CHECKPOINT_PATH} --keypoints cpn_ft_h36m_dbb

```
### Visualization
You can generate visualizations of the model predictions by running:
```
python viz.py --architecture gcn --evaluate checkpoint/pretrained/ckpt_hgcn_best.pth.tar --viz_subject S11 --viz_action Walking --viz_camera 0 --viz_output output.gif --viz_size 3 --viz_downsample 2 --viz_limit 60
```
The script can also export MP4 videos, and supports a variety of parameters (e.g. downsampling/FPS, size, bitrate). See [`viz.py`](viz.py) for more details.
